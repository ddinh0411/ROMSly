## Peer Review Feedback & Next Steps

We overall reacted positively to the peer review of our ROMSly project. The issues posted by NotionWeb mostly revolved around adding new features and they served the purpose of being suggestions for how we could take the project from here. Some of these ideas were of topics or areas that we had previously not considered or overlooked but plan on adding into the future. Currently, we plan to continue with our main priorities such as the implementation of the database management system locally and the inclusion of more blocks to better facilitate the process of using our system. While doing so, we will look through the issues that have been posted along with the NotionWeb team's pull request so that we can better improve our project on the whole. The pull request made to our project will be especially helpful as it was a block that we were in the process of planning but didn't have the time to implement. This block will be the basis for restructuring how we have certain blocks set up and organized to make our project more applicable and better organized for the users of ROMSly.
