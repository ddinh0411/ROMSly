## About ROMSly

ROMSly (Restaurant Order Management System) is a way for restaurants to easily create and manage orders using custom Blockly blocks. Using custom Blockly blocks, the goal is to implement both Python and SQL code to allow users to quickly set up and initialize a database system that is designed and customized for each restaurant or food service location. Our motivation comes from personal experience as several of our team members have previous and current experience within the food service industry, and know of the grievances that with having to record and keep track of numerous orders during busy rush times. The goal is to provide a way to transfer orders from servers and online orders to those in the kitchen more effectively reducing the chance of mixups and possible delays.

This project involves the topic of parsing as we are taking syntax from the user and parsing them into syntax that will be stored into the database to store and organize. The inputs would be start as simple clicks representing both the menu item and where the item was ordered from and need to be parsed into what needs to be cooked by the kitchen staff in the back. The DSL will also abstract complex tasks away from users, allowing users to chain together simple blocks to execute multi-layered, recursive based operations on the database. ROMSly will also perform work unseen to end users to ensure the system runs as smoothly as possible at all times.
